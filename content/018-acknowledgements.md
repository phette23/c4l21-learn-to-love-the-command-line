# Acknowledgements

## Land

Before beginning the workshop, I'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where I am located.    

Oakland is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Ohlone, Muwekma, and Chochenyo peoples.

Please take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

## Software

This website uses [a template](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rc-workshop-template/) from University of British Columbia Library Research Commons which I saw at [Chelsea Palmer's Docker workshop](https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/intro-docker/) and really liked. That template in turn includes this acknowledgement:

> Site template adapted from the [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Jekyll template created by [Patrick Marsceil](https://github.com/pmarsceill) and available under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The software stack uses GitHub, Jekyll, lunr.js for search, and probably many other things.

## Substance

I owe much of my thinking about the content of this workshop to Coral Sheldon-Hess, with whom I co-taught essentially [the same thing at Code4Lib 2016](https://github.com/phette23/c4l16-cli-workshop). Coral also helpfully shared updated content and tips on teaching the CLI since then.

I am also indebted to Ashley Blewer's [Scripting (Bash)](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/bash-scripting.html#2) and [Command Line Interface](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/cli.html#2) slide decks in which I found some inspiration and good ideas.
