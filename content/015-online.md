# Participating online

Active participation enlivens the session with other voices and perspectives. I encourage you to engage with me and with each other.

Please mute your microphone when you are not speaking to reduce potential audio clutter. I do intend to record this session, with your permission, and post the recording publicly. You can turn off your camera if you do not want your image to appear in the recordings and I can edit out segments by request.

# Zoom

The Zoom toolbar provides several ways to be part of the conversation:

## Reactions menu

Open the _Reactions_ menu and click an icon to communicate with the instructor(s).

![Reactions menu](/c4l21-learn-to-love-the-command-line/content/zoom-figures/reactions.png)

Use this to **answer yes/no** questions or to **raise your hand** when instructor(s) invite you to ask a question, comment, or share your screen.

## Chat window

Use the _Chat_ window to comment or ask a question at any time. Instructors will do their best to respond, sometimes waiting for a break in the lesson to do so.

The _Chat_ window is a good place to report problems with your audio connection. Instructors may also use it to share links to material mentioned in the session.

## Share your screen

In some cases instructors may invite you to share your screen. Raise your hand to indicate that you're ready to share. When called upon click _Share screen_, select a window to display, and click _Share_.

## Contribute to the Whiteboard

The _Whiteboard_ is a collaborative space that everyone can annotate with drawings and text. When the whiteboard is shared click _View options_ and select _Annotate_.

This opens the annotation toolbar. Drawings and text you add to the screen will be visible to everyone in the session or breakout room.
