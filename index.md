# Learn to Love the Command Line

This workshop is meant to introduce you to the fundamentals of command line interfaces and to convince you that they're worth learning more about.

## Workshop Objectives

First, we will review some fundamentals of the command line like the syntax of commands, file system operations, and navigating around. Somewhere in here we will learn what exactly a "shell" and "terminal" and "command line interface" are.

Next, we'll move on to more advanced topics that are relevant in shell scripting, like loops and variables. We will see the usage of more sophisticated tools that are commonly used.

Finally, we will conclude with some examples of potential projects made easier by use of the command line and some of the most common and powerful command line utilities.

## Outline

1. Introductions & what _you_ want to get out of the workshop
1. An example & running a terminal on your own
1. Fundamentals of the command line
1. Breakout groups I - exercises & practice
1. More advanced topics
1. Breakout groups II - exercises & practice
1. Further learning, tools, & projects

### Prerequisites

Our topics today come in many variations depending on operating system and software differences. To follow along with examples and do the exercises, **all attendees need access to BASH (the most common shell) in a UNIX-like environment**. What does this mean for you?

- If you are on **Mac OS X** or **Linux**, you are all set
- If you are on **Windows**, please download & install [**Git BASH**](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Chromebooks, tablets, and smartphones generally do not give access to the command line and it would be too challenging to create instructions that work for them

Some commands and exercises may fail for some people. Additionally, installing and using command line software can be tricky, full of obscure configuration files and enigmatic error messages. Hopefully, this workshop gives you the fundamentals to work through these problems but if not, a friendly web search can often find the right answer.
