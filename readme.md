# Learn to Love the Command Line

Postconference workshop at [Code4Lib 2021](https://2021.code4lib.org).

[The workshop website starts here](https://phette23.github.io/c4l21-learn-to-love-the-command-line).

Uses [a template](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rc-workshop-template/) from University of British Columbia Library Research Commons which I saw at [Chelsea Palmer's Docker workshop](https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/intro-docker/) and really liked.
